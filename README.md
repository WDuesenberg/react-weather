Overview
The React Weather application allows users to input any city in the world and then recieve the up tp date
seven day forecast for that city. Users may also click on a certain day to get more specific weather information
according to the day they have selected.

Technology
    React
    Node.js
    Reactstrap
    Bootstrap
    Axios
    Moment
    API (Weatherbit)

Objective
My goal with this application was to gain a better understanding and improve my skills with the use of React.js.
I also wanted to create an application that had a practical daily use and would assist me in showcasing my skills
as a Full Stack Developer.

Future Goals
I will be adding more style to this application and continue to revist the applications code and do anything I see fit to improve its functions and the overall user experience.
